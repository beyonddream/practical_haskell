1. When I noticed [Client Integer], I thought it is a list with heterogenous values.
But what it actually is Client type with Integer as the value of the type variable.

2. Type class is incidentally complex. We separate class definition from instance definition.
For some reason I find it confusing. Can't put a finger on what it is.
